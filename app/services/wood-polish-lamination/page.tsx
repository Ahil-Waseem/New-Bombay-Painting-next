      Professional Wood Polish Services
    </h2>

    <p className="text-gray-300 leading-8">
      Wood polishing is not just about shine — it is about protection and
      longevity. Over time, wooden surfaces can lose their original texture
      due to dust, moisture, sunlight exposure, and daily wear.
      Our expert wood polishing services restore the natural grain and
      enhance the strength of the surface.
